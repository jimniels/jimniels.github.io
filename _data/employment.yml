        title: Digital Content Production
        tools: Sketch app, Invision App, HTML, CSS/Sass, Javascript, React.js, Redux, Bootstrap, Git
        description: "A web application for converting print production into digital content. I conceptualized and wireframed this application. Then, based on the Assignment Desk project framework, I realigned this application’s visual aesthetic to match the client’s other digital efforts while also engineering the view layer of the application. Our team was small, so my duties encompassed product design (aesthetics, visual mocks, style guides), product management (technical specifications, task management), and front-end development (react.js components, form development, sass/css architecture)."
