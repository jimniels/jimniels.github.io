        <em>Who are you?</em> ‚ÄúI am a designer who codes‚Äù is likely the answer
        you‚Äôre looking for, but what I do is solve problems and add value. That
        said, I‚Äôm so much more than my job but this is a website where I talk
        about myself professionally so I have to say these kinds of things.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What are your skills?</em> I design visual interfaces and leverage
        principles of design, color theory, and typography. I write code and
        intimately understand HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. But my skills are tools
        to an end: to solve problems and add value.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What‚Äôs your expertise?</em> My expertise lies in synthesizing
        knowledge across traditionally disparate boundaries. ‚ÄúVisual designer‚Äù,
        ‚ÄúFront-end Developer‚Äù, and ‚ÄúProduct Manager‚Äù are all responsibilities I
        assume in order to add value to a business, to enhance a company‚Äôs
        culture, to bring clarity to a project, or to just get along with humans
        (a task often perceived as a difficult for people who write instructions
        for machines).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>How are you, you know, as a human?</em> Don‚Äôt take it from me, here
        are the words of a peer when I was departing a previous employer: ‚ÄúGonna
        be a real bummer here w/o you. You bring a lot of great design, and a
        lot of not-being-an-asshole-ness.‚Äù
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Do you have anything else to say?</em> Yes, in fact, I‚Äôm glad you
        asked. Everything I am as a designer, developer, and just human in
        general is a result of the wonderful people who I‚Äôve crossed paths with
        in my life. In technology in particular, I‚Äôve worked with some of the
        most

        I enjoy the practice writing because it is a form of seeking clarity to
        me. That said, I don‚Äôt believe a lot of the things I‚Äôve written about in
        the past. Why? Because I‚Äôve learned a lot through both writing and
        direct experience and the more you learn, the more your beliefs evolve.
        It is inevitable. If you believe the same things you believed ten years
        ago, I would suggest that you haven‚Äôt really learned anything. New
        knowledge causes me to reassess my beliefs. The more knowledge you have,
        the broader your perspective is, and the more clearly you see contexts
        and relationships between truth and error. It‚Äôs like your designs from
        years ago. You squirm when you look at them. Why? Because your
        understanding and knowledge and aesthetics have changed and evolved over
        the years. That‚Äôs how I feel about my writing.</p> -->

        @TODO Growing up, my Mom always pies. At the time, I didn‚Äôt know they
        were <em>the best</em> pies. As I grew into my teenage years, I began to
        notice that I didn‚Äôt enjoy eating pies from a restaurant or store like
        all the other kids. Those weren‚Äôt real pies.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my mid-twenties, I moved to New York City and figured if I could buy
        a good pie anywhere in the world, surely I could in NYC. Alas, I still
        found myself wanting for a good pie like Mama used to make. So, I
        figured, if you want something done right you gotta do it yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
        I asked my Mom for her recipe and began making my own pies. So while my
        pie obsession was born out of a drive to <em>eat</em> good pie, now it‚Äôs
        just as much composed of a desire to <em>make</em> a good pie. Making is
        now half the fun!

      <p>
        Circa 2012. I used to post on dribbble, but seeing as I‚Äôm not much of a
        designer anymore‚Äîlet alone I don‚Äôt have anything that fancy, I dono‚Äôt do
        it much anymore. That‚Äôs not to say I don‚Äôt filnd the stuff from the past
        stilll interesting! So i keep it here for nostalgia. Honestly, rather
        than dribbble, I‚Äôd rather just play basketball.

        <a href="https://logo-integrity.jim-nielsen.com">Logo Integrity</a>: a
        visual experiment turned game based on ubiquitos logos.
      </h2>
      <p>
        In <em>A Designer‚Äôs Art</em>, Paul Rand asks: ‚ÄúHow far out of focus can
        an image be and still be recognized?‚Äù He proposes that a well-designed
        logo retains its form and recognizability under the duress of real-world
        use and abuse. For fun, I decided to subject some contemporary logos to
        a form of visual stress and see how well people still recognized them.
