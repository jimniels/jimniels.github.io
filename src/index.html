        <h1>Jim Nielsen: dad, designer, developer (in that order).</h1>

        <h2>Currently: Director of Design & UI Architecture @ SageSure.</h2>

        <p>
          <em>Who are you?</em> “I am a designer who codes” is likely the answer
          you’re looking for, but what I do is solve problems and add value.
          That said, I’m so much more than my job but this is a website where I
          talk about myself professionally so I have to say these kinds of
          things.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>What are your skills?</em> I design visual interfaces and leverage
          principles of design, color theory, and typography. I write code and
          intimately understand HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. But my skills are
          tools to an end: to solve problems and add value.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>What’s your expertise?</em> My expertise lies in synthesizing
          knowledge across traditionally disparate boundaries. “Visual
          designer”, “Front-end Developer”, and “Product Manager” are all
          responsibilities I assume in order to add value to a business, to
          enhance a company’s culture, to bring clarity to a project, or to just
          get along with humans (a task often perceived as a difficult for
          people who write instructions for machines).
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>How are you, you know, as a human?</em> Don’t take it from me,
          here are the words of a peer when I was departing a previous employer:
          “Gonna be a real bummer here w/o you. You bring a lot of great design,
          and a lot of not-being-an-asshole-ness.”
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Do you have anything else to say?</em> Yes, in fact, I’m glad you
          asked. Everything I am as a designer, developer, and just human in
          general is a result of the wonderful people who I’ve crossed paths
          with in my life. In technology in particular, I’ve worked with some of
          the most

          you’ll ever meet—and I didn’t use the word “talented” because they all
          are! More than any project I’ve worked on, I’m proud of the people
          I’ve worked with and learned from. I’m sure you, dear reader, would be
          a wonderful person I could learn from as well.

          Hobby: I ❤️ Pies and Make Them Under the Handle

        <p>
          @TODO Growing up, my Mom always pies. At the time, I didn’t know they
          were <em>the best</em> pies. As I grew into my teenage years, I began
          to notice that I didn’t enjoy eating pies from a restaurant or store
          like all the other kids. Those weren’t real pies.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my mid-twenties, I moved to New York City and figured if I could
          buy a good pie anywhere in the world, surely I could in NYC. Alas, I
          still found myself wanting for a good pie like Mama used to make. So,
          I figured, if you want something done right you gotta do it yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          I asked my Mom for her recipe and began making my own pies. So while
          my pie obsession was born out of a drive to <em>eat</em> good pie, now
          it’s just as much composed of a desire to <em>make</em> a good pie.
          Making is now half the fun!

          @TODO I used to post on dribbble, but seeing as I’m not much of a
          designer anymore—let alone I don’t have anything that fancy, I dono’t
          do it much anymore. That’s not to say I don’t filnd the stuff from the
          past stilll interesting! So i keep it here for nostalgia. Honestly,
          rather than dribbble, I’d rather just play basketball.
