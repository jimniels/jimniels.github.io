    I see myself as a “wheelman” of sorts, but for the web. You see, vehicles come in a myriad of types (motorcycles, cars, semis, tractors, etc.) and configurations (2, 4, or 18 wheels, front-, rear-, or all-wheel drive, manual or automatic transmission, etc.), each requiring their own mechanics for operation. A wheelman can skillfully drive any vehicle at any time without necessarily having prior knowledge of the vehicle itself (the term being derived from car thieves).

  <p>
    Like a wheelman (but for the web) I strive to understand principles which transcend specific implementations or configurations. This enables me to execute on the the myriad of tasks inherent to building web applications – from information architecture to visual design to code.
